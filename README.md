4. After developing, when you are submitting notify us by email, please also include in your email your impression and review of our Surplus App (Honest Review will be appreciated)
5. (not mandatory) Give a glimpse of your developed mobile app in a screen recording and short explanations

# App Developemnt Criteria

1. Fork this repository into your public repository (you may use github if you want to, but please notify us)
2. Push, commit many times in the forked repo as you want, but also consider meaningful commit names, time will be counted right after your init commit
3. Add /firmanserdana as contributors
4. Update readme as how to use the code and app (will be checked blindly, so ensure pre/post-steps/configuration will also be provided)

## Marking and Plus Points
This list is just a guidance, if it's not possible to do the mandatory list, please note it into your readme
1. (Mandatory) Use Open Public API for functional stuff in the random mocked first screen (e.g. weather info at http://www.7timer.info/doc.php?lang=en)
2. (Mandatory) Login credential can be hardcoded, but better to also show case all possible scenarios (success login, failed login, success registering etc.)
3. (Mandatory) App-Styles will be totally considered, make it as beatiful as it can be
4. (Mandaory) Consider multiple phone layouts (the more merrier, but please tell us what phones you are using for developing the app)
5. (Plus Point) ensure cross platform usablity (Android and iOS)
6. (Plus Point) you can use other tech stacks if you want, e.g. Flutter
